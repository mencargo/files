# SSH (~/.ssh)
Generate keys with: `ssh-keygen -t <algorithm> -b <size>` both arguments are optional, default is __\<rsa\>__

Public key should be at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

# GIT

`git init` initializes a local repository (creates a .git folder with initial config)

`git remote set-url origin <url>` set's a remote repository url, or changes an existing one

`git push -u origin master` (prior git add and commit something) will push your staged files to the remote repo

If the repository has already been created remotely, you can just clone it, and it will already have all basic config for a push:

`git clone <url> <new_folder>`

### .gitignore
Useful stuff to ignore in most excercises, use with caution!
```
.*
*.out
*.pdf
main.c
```

### force stuff:
`git add -f main.c` an excercise that asks for a whole program

`git rm -f <wrong_file>` could be __\<folder\>__ with __-rf__

`git checkout master -f <file>` could be the entire repo without __\<file\>__
 
 Completely messed up a local repo and want to start over? Could try `rm -rf .git` in the root repository folder

### check stuff:
`git status` pay attention to the messages
 
`git log` check that your HEAD is in the same commit as origin/master

`git ls-files` list of commited files
 
`git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r <commit-hash>` list of files staged at a specific commit
